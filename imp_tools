INTRODUCTION
My name Samrat Amareshwar Kasarla. I am from gadchiroli. I did my graduation in engineering from sant gadgebaba amaravati university.
Currently i am working in codengine technologies as a devops engineer.

my daily routine in this organisation is to attain daily scrum calls and give progress of the work and discuss if any 
roadblocks i  have. we have release every two weeks. During the sprint i maintain the repository, creating and deleting 
branches, reverting the committs if required. Merging branches after approval from team leader.
